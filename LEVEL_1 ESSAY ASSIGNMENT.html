    <h1 style="text-align:center">My first day in a tech school</h1>


    <p style="text-align:justify">On a faithful morning, i woke up to the sound of prayer from a loud speaker coming from a mosque behind my house calling people for prayer,i was forced to wake up around 5 am as that was not part of my plan,my plan was to wake up by 6 am,because i will be having my first lecture by 8 am,fortunately to my favour, i was able to cook,bathe,dressed up,and eat after without rush.
        I left home around 7:30 am and got to school by 8 am,as soon as i entered into the school compound,i felt different because i was about to start an <i>adventure</i>, a new one to my system, there was a little tension at first due to my zero knowledge about tech prior to my first class,meeting with strangers to becoming close with them is also a challenge.
        We all sat down waiting for our tutor, here comes the most interesting part which is lecture time, i was hoping to see a very big,tall person to come in as our tutor, but to my surprise reverse was the case, a young, cute,well dressed man walked in and introduced himself with a bright smile all over his face.
        Believe me, stature did not do justice to what this intelligent young man caries, so brilliant and i was jealous of him at some point. He gave us lecture which lasted for 2 hours nonstop, it was a very interesting and an interactive class, he asked us some questions which i could not give an answers to,he gave us words of encouragement and i quote <q>say whatever answers comes first to your head,you will always be right</q>, he stated further and said <q>there is no wrong answer in my class,as long as you have an idea</q>
        That word really boosted my morale and i told myself that <b>I CAN DO IT</b>, he gave us an assignment at the end of the class. The young guru i was talking about since goes by the name <b>Dr. Anonymous</b> in case you meet with him someday. That was the beautiful experience i had <i>on my first day in tech school</i>.
