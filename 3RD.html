    1. Application security </p></h1>
        Application security prevents unauthorized access and use of applications and connected data. Because most vulnerabilities are introduced during the development and publishing stages, application security includes many types of cybersecurity solutions to help identify flaws during the design and development phases that could be exploited and alert teams so they can be fixed.Despite best efforts, flaws do slip through the cracks. Application security also helps protect against these vulnerabilities.  

        A subset of application security is web application security. It focuses on protecting web applications, which are frequently targeted by cyber
       <h1><p> 2. Cloud security </p></h1>
        Cloud security focuses on protecting cloud-based assets and services, including applications, data, and infrastructure. Most cloud security is managed as a shared responsibility between organizations and cloud service providers.  
        
        In this shared responsibility model, cloud service providers handle security for the cloud environment, and organizations secure what is in the cloud. Generally, the responsibilities are divided as shown below.  <a href="https://www.sailpoint.com/identity-library/five-types-of-cybersecurity/" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
