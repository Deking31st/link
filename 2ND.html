    <p>Cybersecurity is a set of standards and practices organizations use to protect their applications, data, programs, networks, and systems from cyber attacks and unauthorized access. Cybersecurity threats are rapidly increasing in sophistication as attackers use new techniques and social engineering to extort money from organizations and users, disrupt business processes, and steal or destroy sensitive information. 

        To protect against these activities, organizations require technology cybersecurity solutions and a robust process to detect and prevent threats and remediate a cybersecurity breach.

                <h1><b>How Does Cybersecurity Work?</b></h1>
            </dt>
        </ol>What is cybersecurity in the context of your enterprise? An effective cybersecurity plan needs to be built on multiple layers of protection. Cybersecurity companies provide solutions that integrate seamlessly and ensure a strong defense against cyber attacks.
        <ol><li><b>People</b></li></ol><p> Employees need to understand data security and the risks they face, as well as how to report cyber incidents for critical infrastructure. This includes the importance of using secure passwords, avoiding clicking links or opening unusual attachments in emails, and backing up their data. In addition, employees should know exactly what to do when faced with a ransomware attack or if their computer detects ransomware malware. In this way, each employee can help stop attacks before they impact critical systems.
            <p>2. <b>Infrastructure</b>
                Organizations need a solid framework that helps them define their cybersecurity approach and mitigate a potential attack. It needs to focus on how the organization protects critical systems, detects and responds to a threat, and recovers from an attack. As part of cybersecurity awareness, your infrastructure should also include concrete steps each employee needs to take in the event of an attack. By having this kind of emergency response manual, you can limit the degree to which attacks impact your business.</p>
                <p>3. <b>Vulnerabilities</b>
                    A cybersecurity solution needs to prevent the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited. This includes protecting all devices, cloud systems, and corporate networks. When thinking about vulnerabilities, it’s also important to include those introduced by remote and hybrid employees. Consider vulnerabilities in the devices they use to work, as well as the networks they may connect to as they log into your system.</p>
                    <p>4. <b>Technology</b>
                        Technology is crucial to protecting organizations' devices, networks, and systems. Critical cybersecurity technologies include antivirus software, email security solutions, and next-generation firewalls (NGFWs). It’s important to keep in mind that your technology portfolio is only as good as the frequency and quality of its updates. Frequent updates from reputable manufacturers and developers provide you with the most recent patches, which can mitigate newer attack methods.<a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-cybersecurity" target="_blank">read more</a> </p>
